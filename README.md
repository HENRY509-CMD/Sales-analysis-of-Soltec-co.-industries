### Project overview.

This project will serve as a peeking eye into the sales data of a certain company over a period of six months, reviewing their sales history and identifying their sales patterns.

### Data Sources.
Sales Data: The primary data sources used for this sample is the "Sales_data.Xls"file, containing the detailed information of each sale made by the company.

### Tools.

Excel - Data cleaning and visualization.

### Data Cleaning.

In the initial preparation phase the following was done:
1.Data Loading and Inspection.
2.Updating of sales data date to current date.
3.Data cleaning and formatting.

### Exploratory Data Analysis.

EDA involved exploring this sales data to answer the following questions:

- What is the overall sales trend?
- Who are the top performant managers?
- Which products are more profitable to sale?
- Which periods are more suitable for sales?

### Data analysis.

```Excel
Use of pivot tables and pivot charts
```

### Results/Findings.

Our findings are as follows:
1. The sales pattern is relatively stable with a slight peak in the month of APRIL.
2. Memory cards are the most sold products under both stores.
3. The town of Sheffield generates the most revenue, followed by Flitwick, Richmond, Coverty and Rye.
4. Hugo is the most Profitable manager.
5. Computech generated more overall revenue compared to Microworld.

### Recommendations

Based on the given analysis, i recommend the following:
- Invest in marketing and more advertisements during peak sales seasons to maximise revenue.
- Increase supply to the COMPUTECH store since it has higher over all sales.
- Placing manager HUGO in charge of more towns.
- Reduce any non-essential costs in the month june, given it doesn't yeild as much profit as the other months.

### limitations

I had to change the date of all the purchases from 2017 to 2023 to ensure the overall data was compliant to the analysis.
