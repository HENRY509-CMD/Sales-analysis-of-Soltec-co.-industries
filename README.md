### Data Sources.
Sales Data: The primary data sources used for this sample is the "Sales_data.xlsx" file, containing the detailed information of each sale made by the company.

### Tools.

Excel - Data cleaning and visualization.

### Data Cleaning.

In the initial preparation phase the following was done:
1.Data Loading and Inspection.
2.Updating of sales data date to current date.
3.Data cleaning and formatting.

### Exploratory Data Analysis.

EDA involved exploring this sales data to answer the following questions:

- What is the overall sales trend?
- Which towns generate the most revenue?
- Which products are more profitable to sale?
- Which periods are more suitable for sales?


### Findings.

Our findings are as follows:
1. The sales pattern is relatively stable with a slight peak in the month of APRIL.
2. Memory cards are the most sold products under both stores.
3. The town of BEDFORD generates the most revenue, followed by Sheffield, Doncaster, and Flitwick.
4. Computech generated more overall revenue compared to Microworld.

### Recommendations

Based on the given analysis, i recommend the following:
- Invest in marketing and more advertisements during peak sales seasons to maximise revenue.
- Increase supply to the COMPUTECH store since it has higher over all sales.
- Reduce any non-essential costs in the month june, given it doesn't yield as much profit as the other months.

### limitations

I had to change the date of all the purchases from 2017 to 2023 to ensure the overall data was compliant to the analysis.
I could only use Excel for both data cleaning and visualization since i was only proficient in it back then.
